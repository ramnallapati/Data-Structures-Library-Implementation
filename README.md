Project Title: Data Structures and Algorithms Implementation<br>
Description
This project is a comprehensive implementation of various fundamental data structures and algorithms in Python. It serves as a practical resource for understanding the underlying principles of data structures and their applications in solving computational problems. The project includes implementations of common data structures such as:

Binary Tree
Min Heap
Max Heap
Graph
Queue
Stack
Trie
Each data structure is implemented with essential operations, and the project also includes unit tests to ensure the correctness of the implementations.

Features
Binary Tree: Supports insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal methods (inorder, preorder, postorder).
Min Heap: Implements a priority queue with methods for insertion, extraction of the minimum element, and peeking at the minimum.
Max Heap: Similar to Min Heap but prioritizes the maximum element.
Graph: Implements an adjacency list representation with methods for adding vertices and edges, as well as breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) traversals.
Queue: A simple queue implementation with methods for adding and removing elements, checking if the queue is empty, and displaying its contents.
Stack: Implements stack operations including push, pop, and peek.
Trie: A prefix tree implementation for efficient retrieval of strings, supporting insertion, search, and deletion of words
