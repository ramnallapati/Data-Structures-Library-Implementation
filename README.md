Project Title: Data Structures and Algorithms Implementation<br>
Description<br>
<p>This project is a comprehensive implementation of various fundamental data structures and algorithms in Python. It serves as a practical resource for understanding the underlying principles of data structures and their applications in solving computational problems. The project includes implementations of common data structures such as:</p><br>

Binary Tree<br>
Min Heap<br>
Max Heap<br>
Graph<br>
Queue<br>
Stack<br>
Trie<br>
Each data structure is implemented with essential operations, and the project also includes unit tests to ensure the correctness of the implementations.<br>

<h3>Features</h3><br>
Binary Tree: Supports insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal methods (inorder, preorder, postorder).<br>
Min Heap: Implements a priority queue with methods for insertion, extraction of the minimum element, and peeking at the minimum.<br>
Max Heap: Similar to Min Heap but prioritizes the maximum element.<br>
Graph: Implements an adjacency list representation with methods for adding vertices and edges, as well as breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) traversals.<br>
Queue: A simple queue implementation with methods for adding and removing elements, checking if the queue is empty, and displaying its contents.<br>
Stack: Implements stack operations including push, pop, and peek.<br>
Trie: A prefix tree implementation for efficient retrieval of strings, supporting insertion, search, and deletion of words<br>
